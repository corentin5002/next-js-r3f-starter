This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Notes for development

From this date : 12/10/2024, I've clone this project from this repository : [r3f-shader-starter](https://github.com/sekeidesign/r3f-shader-starter) and modify it to be a custom starter for r3f project with shader. 
However I use js instead of ts, so at the moment I won't dive into the ts configuration. but it needs to be removed further.
